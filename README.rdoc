== DESCRIPTION

Crypt3 is a pure Ruby version of crypt(3) --a salted one-way
hashing of a password.

Supported hashing algorithms are: md5, sha1, sha256, sha384,
sha512, rmd160. Only the md5 hashing algorithm is standard
and compatible with crypt(3); the others are non-standard.


== FEATURES/LIMITATIONS

* Standard compliant crypt(3) implementation
* Supports alternate hashing algorithms
* Written in Ruby
* But, it depends on Ruby's standard digest libraries
